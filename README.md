# The Assimp-Model-Database
The Asset-Importer-Lib model database - a collection of free models, links to common model-databases, free or commercials, other importer libraries and model specifications. If you need to start working on a special format you can use this list to find useful resources.

## The Model-Database

## List of awesome model importer libraries
- [The Asset-Importer-Lib](http://www.assimp.org/) - Open Asset Import Library (short name: Assimp) is a portable Open Source library to import various well-known 3D model formats in a uniform manner. The most recent version also knows how to export 3d files and is therefore suitable as a general-purpose 3D model converter.
- [OpenFBX](https://github.com/nem0/OpenFBX) - Lightweight open source FBX importer
- [FBX](https://github.com/jskorepa/fbx) - C++ Library for reading and writing FBX files
- [fbx](https://github.com/origamicomet/fbx) -  Single-file binary FBX importer.
- [StepCode](https://github.com/stepcode/stepcode) - STEPcode (formerly NIST's STEP Class Library) is used with IFC, STEP, and other standards that utilize the technologies of ISO10303 (STEP). It generates C++ and Python from EXPRESS (10303-11) schemas. The code is capable of reading and writing STEP Part 21 exchange files. It also utilizes Parts 22 and 23 (SDAI and its C++ binding). http://stepcode.org
- [TinyGLTF](https://github.com/syoyo/tinygltf) - Header only C++11 tiny glTF 2.0 library
- [glTF-Toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/glTF-Toolkit) - A collection of tools for modifying and optimizing glTF assets
- [FBX2glTF](https://github.com/facebookincubator/FBX2glTF) - A command-line tool for the conversion of 3D model assets on the FBX file format to the glTF file format.
- [IfcOpenShell](IfcOpenShell) - Open source IFC library and geometry engine
- [Meshoptimizer](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer) - Mesh optimization library that makes meshes smaller and faster to render
- [lib3mf](https://github.com/3MFConsortium/lib3mf) - Lib3MF is the reference implementation of the 3D Manufacturing Format file standard http://3mf.io
- [Mesh-processing-library](https://github.com/Microsoft/Mesh-processing-library) - C++ library and programs that demonstrate mesh processing techniques in computer graphics published at ACM SIGGRAPH in 1992–1998

## List of awesome model / asset utility libraries and applications
- [binary-gltf-utils](https://github.com/Qantas94Heavy/binary-gltf-utils) - Bundles glTF models, images, shaders and other assets into a Binary glTF (.glb) file.
## How to contribute
- Clone from this repository 
- Prepare a branch with your model in it. Place the model at the model-bd, select the name of the format in the folder and create another
  folder with the name of your model. If you want o share some special information abou the model add a readme-file.
- Create a pull-request
- The pull-request will be reviewed and merged afterwards. We will add your name to the list of contributors.
